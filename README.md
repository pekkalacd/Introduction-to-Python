**TABLE OF CONTENTS**<br>
This is a one-page page table of contents file containing the order by which the lessons accumulate along with links to each specific lesson and the resources used to construct each lesson. 

<br>

**LESSONS**<br>
This is the parent folder containing all of the individual lesson folders. 

<br>

**LESSON SUB-FOLDER**<br>
This is noted as "Lesson 1 (Folder)" above. This is a sub-folder, within the "Lessons" parent directory, containing the contents for a specific lesson. In this repository, it will have a name corresponding to the name of the lesson. The name of the folder will correspond to the name of the jupyter notebook file. For example,
the first lesson will be called *Basic Overview*, so the sub-folder will be called "Basic Overview" and the actual overview will be "Basic Overview.ipynb" (the jupyter notebook).

<br>

**EXAMPLES**<br>
This is a folder containing the example code for the corresponding lesson. Each Lesson folder within the parent folder Lessons, will have it's own "Examples" Folder. 

<br>

**EXERCISES**<br>
This is a folder containing one file, a jupyter notebook containing exercise questions to practice what you learn in the lesson. Each Lesson folder within the parent folder Lessons, will have it's own "Exercises" folder.
